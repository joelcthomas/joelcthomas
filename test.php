			<p>I consider myself part scientist, part artist and which are inextricably connected by mathematics. I am an avid lover of nature and am always fascinated by Fibonacci numbers in nature, logarithmic spirals in nautilus or the fractals or the golden ratio, etc. As Galileo said, “the book of nature is written in mathematical characters” and I derive most of my inspirations from it. And as Seneca, Roman Philosopher, said, “All art is but imitation of nature”. As much as I love math since I was young, I was also captivated by science. In general, physics is nothing but applied math and chemistry is applied physics.

			<p>Instead of looking at every problem as the same kind of nail that could be solved with the single hammer, I enjoy working with multiple tool sets to find the right hammer. I solve complex problems by looking at it holistically, but by using a variety of programming tools concurrently, to solve subtasks efficiently, which are then integrated seamlessly.
